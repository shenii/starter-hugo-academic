My research focuses on the ecology and evolution of multispecies interactions. I am broadly interested in the evolutionary ecology of host-microbe interactions with the overall goal of understanding how microbial organisms spread, persist, and affect their host populations.

My current work seeks to understand how host-microbe symbioses impact evolutionary outcomes in host populations. I use experimental evolution and mathematical modeling approaches to understand how host-microbe symbioses, ranging from mutualistic to pathogenic interactions, modify virulence evolution in changing environments.

I received my PhD in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan. Subsequently, I held an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in Biology in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California Berkeley. I am currently a Carolina Fellow for Faculty Diversity and USDA NIFA Fellow at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
